                <h3>Biden reacts to Kamala Harris gaffe and Trump's mockery, 'I know the difference between...'</h3>
                <p>Donald Trump seized the opportunity to mock President Joe Biden's slip-up during 
                   his 'Big Boy' press conference. Following Biden's earlier gaffe of mistakenly referring
                   to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as 'President Putin', the POTUS sparked another round of 
                   internet mockery with yet another embarrassing moment. As he began to take questions, the president stumbled almost immediately. </p>
